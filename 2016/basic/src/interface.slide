* Interface

Interfaces are named collections of method signatures.

If a variable has an interface type, then we can call methods that are in the named interface.


* Excercise: Surface

Define the interface *Surface* with a method signature to compute the *Area* (float64) of a Graphic.

Create implementations for each graphic type (Circle, Rectangle)

Print the results.

* Solution: Surface

.code interface.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/
