T

* Theory: Struct

Using the struct type you can define composite types.

A struct can have zero or more fields ; each field must be typed.

A struct can embed other structs "borrowing" the state and behavior of the embedded type.

*Not* inheritance

* Exercise: Graphic

Define types to model Rectangle,Circle and Point and use struct embedding.

* Solution: Graphic
