* go-restful

Before release v3

- create a branch v3 to merge into master 
- add go.mod
- update CHANGES.md
- do NOT include breaking changes (despite it is a major version upgrade)
- update README.md to describe how consumers can migrate

After release v3

- update my own consumers

    import (
        "github.com/emicklei/go-restful/v3" // imports as package "restful"
    )
