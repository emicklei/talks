* Bits of History

* Bits of History

Once upon a time, your programs always had to use the *latest* *greatest* dependent packages

or whatever commit | branch | tag you had locally

And there was GOPATH ...

* GOPATH example

.image img/gopath_pkg.png _ 700
echo $GOPATH
/Users/emicklei/go

* GOPATH example: go-spew

And live was good ...

Until it wasn't !

Then with Go version 1.5 came *Vendoring*

An idea which I saw first being applied in *Ruby* *on* *Rails*

Now we can freeze all the code (and make local changes)

 GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1

default since 1.6

Then with Go 1.11 came *Go* *Modules*

_Dependency_ _done_ _right_

(for a while we had the vgo experiment)

* Go Modules

* Module

is a way to group together a set of packages and give it a version number to mark itâ€™s state at a specific point in time


    Modules record precise dependency requirements and create reproducible builds.

So modules need unqiue identifiers

    Modules use Semantic Versioning

* Semantic Versioning

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

* Minimal Version Selection (MVS)


MVS ensure that the library versions I compile with today will be the same versions that my co-maintainer compiles with tomorrow

    your go.mod says use v1.2

    author just released v1.2.1

    author later releases v1.3


MVS does not automatically update minor version you will need to pay attention to bug and security point releases for your dependencies.

* Semantic Import Versioning



Semantic Import Versioning locks a dependency to a major version you will need to be aware of new major version releases and upgrade when you want the new functionality they offer.

* Vendor your Modules

    go mod vendor

* Modulizing go-restful

* go-restful

package for building REST-style Web Services using Go.

One of my last packages that do not have a *go.mod*.

Latest git tag is *v2.11.1* and it follows semver strictly.

* go-restful considerations

Follow Go team recommendation to add */v3* folder with copy of sources ?

Process *deprecated* warnings when moving to v3 ?

How many projects are still on the GOPATH because of its age ?
