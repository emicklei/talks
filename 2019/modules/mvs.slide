* Minimal Version Selection (MVS)


MVS ensure that the library versions I compile with today will be the same versions that my co-maintainer compiles with tomorrow

    your go.mod says use v1.2

    author just released v1.2.1

    author later releases v1.3


MVS does *not* *automatically* *update* minor version you will need to pay attention to bug and security point releases for your dependencies.
