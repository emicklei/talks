* Semantic Import Versioning

Semantic Import Versioning locks a dependency to a major version you will need to be aware of new major version releases and upgrade when you want the new functionality they offer.

    import "github.com/me/foobar/v3"

Then the Go tooling will look for:

    v3.*.* tags in repository github.com/me/foobar

or 
    
    /v3 subdirectory of repository github.com/me/foobar
