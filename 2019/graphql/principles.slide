* Server Development approach

- Schema first design
- Frontend teams write types,queries and mutations
- Code generate all types
- Handcode the resolvers
- Open-source Go package(s) where possible

Resolver is a function that returns the data for a for given GraphQL query or mutation operation or data field.
